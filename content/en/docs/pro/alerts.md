The alerts do not allow you to constantly look at the charts, but react only to some interesting moments.  
At the moment there are 2 types of alerts - Range5m and DExt.  
They work on the principle of appearance of a new leader on the corresponding sorting page in the screen.  
You can enable or disable the necessary ones, because when BTC moves a lot of notifications come from DExt, and it is easier to turn them off temporarily.  
Alerts pop up in the form of notifications and a simple voice message. You can click on the name of the coin in the notification and go to the coin control page.
