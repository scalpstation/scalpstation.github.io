This section gets the alerts, shifting all the previous and alerts in it.  
It contains all alerts, regardless of whether they are enabled or not. Later it will be possible to filter them.  
Ribbon makes it easier to monitor because you don't have to switch sorts.  
Unlike the screener, which allows you to instantly assess the situation, but is not very convenient for constant monitoring, you can look at the ribbon for 5 minutes after a new coin appears (it's more convenient to turn on voice notifications), and then go back to your business.
