When you click on the coin name in the screenshot, the coin page opens. It has a bunch of information that can help you make decisions. Everything is updated directly from binans, but with a lot of activity, like everywhere else, it can be sluggish.

### ViewCharts

* Minutes (spot and futures), for maximum control
* BTCUSDT - 1m and 5m - to assess the impact and use as a guide, as well as to quickly exit the transaction if something suspicious starts to happen with BTC
* Additional timeframe-switching spot and futures charts. They allow you to make strategic decisions
* Spot and futures stack in USDT terms. In general, the bright green and bright red numbers are important - relatively large bids for a given coin. The rest of the numbers are more just for the general view. Probably, the cup will be still to be worked out.
* The tape of transactions is made in the form of snapshots for several time intervals. By it you can assess the prevalence of active market seller and buyer and its attenuation. The most informative field is 5s. It can be compared to the 5m. If sales prevailed for 5 minutes, but in the last 5 seconds sales decline and even buying begins, it can indicate a very local increase in buyer's strength. This can be used as an additional indicator.
